Look closer into rapid charging costs (parking, plug in): Ecotricity, enginie, polar, genie, take avg cus seems low rn

Dynamic tariffs - can get as low as 0.04 per kW, changes every half an hr, ask Alistair. Scheduling - change back to old csv format (ver 7)

Separate problems:
1. Can u optimise charging in the day?
- as random as possible to test parameters of also
- what are realistic shift patterns?

2. Can u optimise charging overnight?

For some clients, schedules can become output. They want to know what scheduling will maximise efficiency w driving.

Scoring/priority for charging (higher score during lower tariff)

Demand side response - energy companies/national grid turns up power plants when there is demand for energy, but what they want to do is give less power to some industries/sytems when other industries/systems demand more
