D2
calculate amount of charge needed for the next drive

D3
data:
(telematics data)
- dataId, datetime, vrnId, lat & long, battkW, events, mpkw, mileage, inDepot, chargePt, currentChargeRate, previousLeavetime, previousEntertime, predictedLeavetime(morning)


b)
find similar trips
assume one end of the trip is the depo
perform machine learning to estimate when vehicle is going to enter depot next






Look closer into rapid charging costs (parking, plug in): Ecotricity, enginie, polar, genie, take avg cus seems low rn

Dynamic tariffs - can get as low as 0.04 per kW, changes every half an hr, ask Alistair. Scheduling - change back to old csv format (ver 7)

Separate problems:
1. Can u optimise charging in the day?
- as random as possible to test parameters of also
- what are realistic shift patterns?

2. Can u optimise charging overnight?

For some clients, schedules can become output. They want to know what scheduling will maximise efficiency w driving.

Scoring/priority for charging (higher score during lower tariff)

Demand side response - energy companies/national grid turns up power plants when there is demand for energy, but what they want to do is give less power to some industries/sytems when other industries/systems demand more
